# VirClust

## VirClust is a bioinformatics tool which can be used for:  

• virus clustering  

• protein annotation  

• core protein calculation  

At its core is the grouping of viral proteins into clusters of three different levels:  

• at the first level, proteins are grouped based on their reciprocal BLASTP similarities into protein clusters, or PCs.  

• at the second level, PCs are grouped based on their Hidden Markov Model (HMM) similarities into protein superclusters, or PSCs.  

• at the third, still experimental level, PSCs are grouped based on their HMM similarities into protein super-superclusters, or PSSC.
